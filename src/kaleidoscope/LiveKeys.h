/// This is structure of `Key` values, indexed by `KeyAddr` values, with one
/// entry per key on the keyboard. These entries are meant to represent the
/// current state of the keys, with two special values:
///
/// - `Key_Inactive` indicates that the given key is not active. Usually this
///   will correspond to the keyswitch being off (not pressed).
///
/// - `Key_Masked` indicates that the given key has been masked. When a key
///   release event is processed for that key, it will be reset to
///   `Key_Inactive`.
///
/// Any other value indicates that the key is active (i.e. pressed, though
/// plugins can set entries to active even when the physical keyswitches are not
/// engaged), and the `Key` value is what the that key is "sending" at the
/// time. At the end of its processing of a `KeyEvent`, Kaleidoscope will use
/// the contents of this array to populate the Keyboard HID reports.
