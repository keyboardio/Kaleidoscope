namespace kaleidoscope {

// This is the set of return values for event handlers. Event handlers for
// plugins are called in sequence by the corresponding hook function, in plugin
// initialization order. The interpretation of these return values can vary
// based on the needs of the hook function, but should be as follows:
//
// - OK: Continue processing the event. The calling hook function should
//       continue calling next event handler in the sequence. If all event
//       handlers return `OK`, finish processing the event.
//
// - EVENT_CONSUMED: Stop processing event handlers. The calling hook function
//       should not call any further handlers, but may continue to take some
//       actions to finish processing the event. This should be used to indicate
//       that the event has been successfully handled.
//
// - ABORT: Ignore the event. The calling hook function should not call any
//       further handlers, and should treat the event as if it didn't
//       happen. This should be used by plugin handlers that need to either
//       suppress an event or queue the event in order to delay it.
//
// - ERROR: Undefined error. The calling hook function should not call any
//       further handlers. There is currently no specification for what should
//       happen if this is returned.
