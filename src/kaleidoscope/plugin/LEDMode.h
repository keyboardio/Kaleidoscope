/** Base class for LED modes.

* LED modes are a special kind of plugin, they are in charge of updating LED
* colors, setting a theme. While it is possible to have other plugins
* override the mode's colors, the LED mode is the baseline.
*
* Most of its functionality is called via @ref LEDControl, with only a few
* public methods.
*
* A LED mode **must** implement at least one of @ref onActivate or @ref
* update, and possibly @ref refreshAt too.

   *
   * However, unlike @ref setup, this method can change LED colors, if so
   * desired. Either to provide an initial state, or a static color set. In the
   * latter case, consider implementing @ref refreshAt too, because other
   * plugins may override some of the colors set at activation time, and @ref
   * refreshAt can be used to restore them when needed.
