  // The phase offset is provided in case one wants more than one breathe effect
  // differing in phase at the same time. This may be useful for individual
  // indicators that need to contrast with any other overall breathe effect.
  // (Offset value 128 giving 50% ie opposite phase is especially nice.)
  //
  // The actual breathe computation function has a period of 4096. The input
  // phase offset ranges from 0 to 255. This is to be scaled to the actual
  // period 0 to 4096. To allow precise offsets of 25%, 50% etc, and for
  // computational convenience and speed (and since one would not meaningfully
  // request an offset of 4096 for 255 to be mapped to it), we merely multiply
  // the input offset by 16 (== 4096/256), or equivalently lshift it by 4.

  // We do a bit shift here instead of division to ensure that there's no discontinuity
  // in the output brightness when the integer overflows.
