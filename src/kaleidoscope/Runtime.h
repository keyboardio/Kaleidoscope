  /** Determines if a timer has expired.
   *
   * This method should be used whenever checking to see if a timeout has been
   * reached. It correctly computes timeout values even when integer overflow
   * occurs, given a start time and a timeout. It takes two parameters:
   *
   * - start_time: A timestamp when the timer started, which should be set by
   *      calling `Runtime.millisAtCycleStart()`. It can be any integer
   *      type.
   *
   * - ttl: The timeout value or interval to check (ttl = "time to live"). The
   *      timer expires (and `hasTimeExpired()` returns true) when the time that
   *      has elapsed since `start_time` exceeds this value. It must be an
   *      integer type that is no bigger than the type of `start_time`.
   *
   * Warning: When using hasTimeExpired, make sure that the value of ttl
   *          is at least by the size of the call interval smaller than
   *          the maximum value that the datatype of timeout can store.
   *          Otherwise false negatives are likely to occur
   *          when checking (elapsed_time > ttl).
   *
   * Example: When both arguments of hasTimeExpired are of type uint16_t and
   *          the function is called in every cycle with a cycle duration
   *          of x ms, the value of ttl must not be larger than
   *          std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max() - x.

   * events. It takes only one parameter, of type `KeyEvent`, which encapsulates

   *
   * - `event.key_addr`: The address of the key that was pressed or released.
   * - `event.state`: The state of the keyswitch event (toggled on or off).
   * - `event.key`: The `Key` value for this event.
   * - `event.id`: A semi-unique ID value for the event.
   *
   * The ID value is used to help plugins that delay events to coordinate with
   * each other so that they can avoid re-processing the same event, possibly
   * causing endless loops.
