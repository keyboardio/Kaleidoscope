 * optimize this whole thing out if it is unused. It can do that because
 * instantiating `SingleAbsoluteMouse` is in a separate compilation unit.
 *
 * While it would have been cleaner and shorter to instantiate them here, and
 * drop the global objects, that prevents optimizing them out, and that's a cost
 * we do not want to pay.
