// This file includes whatever hardware plugin is specified during the build.
// Depending on which device is targeted, you can find the sources in one of the
// following files under the `plugins` directory:
//
// `Kaleidoscope-Hardware-<make>-<model>/src/kaleidoscope/device/<make>/<model>.h`
//
// Each hardware device header defines a types `kaleidoscope::Device` and
// `kaleidoscope::DeviceProps` by using the `EXPORT_DEVICE()` preprocessor
// macro, which then becomes available to client code by means of this header.
// Client code should not include specific hardware device headers directly.
//
// `KALEIDOSCOPE_HARDWARE_H` gets defined during the build process like this:
// The fully-qualified board name (fqbn) is read from the `sketch.yaml` file (in
// the same directory as the sketch's *.ino file), and that tells Arduino which
// core to use and which definition to read from `boards.txt`, which adds
// compiler flags that set `KALEIDOSCOPE_HARDWARE_H` to the appropriate header
// for the hardware plugin.
//
// For a description of the API for the `kaleidoscope::Device` class, see the
// base device class definition in the following file:
//
// `kaleidoscope/device/Base.h`
