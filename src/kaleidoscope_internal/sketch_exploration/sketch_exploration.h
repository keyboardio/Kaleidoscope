// About compile-time-only functions (COMPILE_TIME_USE_ONLY)
//
// On Harvard architecture an array like the Kaleidoscope keymap
// that is declared 'constexpr PROGMEM' must either be accessed
// by a runtime function through functions like pgm_read_byte
// or at compile time with ordinary array access. Using normal array
// access at run-time will cause a memory access failures as the MCU
// will try to read from SRAM instead of PROGMEM.
//
// There are some functions that are therefore restricted to compile-time
// use and will fail if instantiated by the compiler. There is no language
// inherent means to prevent the latter. Therefore, we flag all such functions
// as
//
// COMPILE_TIME_USE_ONLY
//
// Call such functions consistently as
//
// constexpr auto val = aCompileTimeOnlyFunction(...);
//
// This ensures that they can not be instantiated and called at runtime.
//

// This macro defines a Sketch interface class that is passed to the
// exploreSketch<_Sketch>(...)-hook.
