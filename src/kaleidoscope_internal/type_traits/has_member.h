// It defines a traits class that enables checking if a class
// defines a member (no matter if function or data member) with a given
// name. So what the class does is essentially checking if a equally
// named member in a helper base class (a mixin) is hidden by a
// reimplementation. The traits can by no means answer the question if
// the member that is implemented in the class being checked is
// a data or a function member. But for many applications that is of
// no great importance, which makes this technique very valuable.

// The code is highly complex that's why so many words are necessary to
// explain what it does. But the explanations are good enough to actually
// understand what's going on.
