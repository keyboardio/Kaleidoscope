/*
 * We want to be able to override the short name of the device. For that, we
 * currently need to override `HID_::getShortName`, but due to link ordering, we
 * need to do that in the user sketch. For this reason, `_INIT_HID_GETSHORTNAME`
 * gets called from the `KEYMAPS` macro.
 *
 * TODO(anyone): Once we have a better way to override the short name, remove
 * this workaround.
