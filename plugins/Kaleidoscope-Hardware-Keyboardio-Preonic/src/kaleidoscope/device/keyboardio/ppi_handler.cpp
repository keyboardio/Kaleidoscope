/**
 * PPI-based GPIO PORT event handler
 * 
 * This implementation is based on the solution by jgartrel:
 * https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/issues/754#issuecomment-1437329605
 * 
 * This file implements the SWI3_EGU3 interrupt handler that receives GPIO PORT events
 * via the PPI (Programmable Peripheral Interconnect) system. This approach allows us
 * to handle PORT events without conflicting with the Arduino core's GPIOTE handler.
 * 
 * The flow is:
 * 1. A key is pressed or rotary encoder turned, pulling a GPIO pin LOW
 * 2. This triggers a PORT event in the GPIOTE peripheral
 * 3. Via PPI, the PORT event triggers EGU3 channel 0
 * 4. This causes the SWI3_EGU3_IRQHandler to be called
 * 5. The handler calls setInputEventPending which tells Kaleidoscope to start scanning for events again
 * 
 * Note: The handler must be declared with extern "C" to prevent name mangling,
 * ensuring it matches the interrupt vector table entry exactly.
