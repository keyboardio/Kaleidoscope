// When adding, removing, or changing ranges, make sure that existing ranges are
// never accidentally moved. If migrating keycodes that weren't previously using
// the range system, make sure you don't change the `Key` values. If an existing
// `Key` value is changed, it won't be a problem for the Kaleidoscope sketch
// itself, but it will cause problems for keymap entries stored in EEPROM
// (i.e. Chrysalis keymap layers), which will not get updated by flashing the
// firmware.
//
// When adding new `Key` values for plugins, to keep them backwards-compatible,
// they must be added at the end of the range below (just before `SAFE_START`),
// even if those values are logically related to existing ones. This is
// important for compatibility with existing Chrysalis keymaps, despite the fact
// that it makes the code more obtuse here.
