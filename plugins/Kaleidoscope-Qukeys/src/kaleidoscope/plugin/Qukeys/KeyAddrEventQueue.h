// events, recording the key address, a timestamp, and the keyswitch state
// (press or release). It is optimized for random access to the queue entries,
// so that each property of each entry can be retrieved without fetching any
// other data, in order to best serve the specific needs of the Qukeys
// plugin. Its performance is better for a queue that needs to be searched much
// more frequently than entries are added or removed.
