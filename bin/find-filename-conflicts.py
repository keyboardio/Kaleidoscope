"""When building Kaleidoscope, the compiled object files are linked together
into a static archive. This static archive has a very simple structure, and only
stores filenames, not paths, not even relative ones. As such, we can't have
files with the same name, because they will conflict, and one will override the
other.

To avoid this situation, this script will find all cpp source files (we don't
need to care about header-only things, those do not result in an object file),
and will comb through them to find conflicting filenames.

If a conflict is found, it will print all files that share the name, and will
exit with an error at the end. It does not exit at the first duplicate, but will
find and print all of them.

If no conflict is found, the script just prints its status message and exits
with zero."""
